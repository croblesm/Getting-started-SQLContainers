# [DBA Fundamentals - PASS](https://fundamentals.pass.org/)
# Getting Started with SQL Containers on Docker & Kubernetes

Containers offer efficiency, flexibility, and portability out of the box, becoming a popular platform for application and database developers who wants to build sandbox environments without the burdens of a complex infrastructure. 

This session will provide you a basic understanding; also, guidelines and options we have when working with SQL Server containers, whether on Docker or Kubernetes. Spending extended periods installing, configuring, and preparing databases and SQL Server instances are no longer the cases with containers.

You will be able to leverage SQL Server containers to build database environments quickly at the end of this session.
